Check and Repair tools:

- Set the receivable/payable account of the partners, in moves and invoices
  where a generic receivable/payable account was used instead.

- Set the parent reference in account move lines where the receivable/payable
  account associated with the partner was used, but a partner reference wasn't
  set. This may fix cases where the receivable/payable amounts displayed in the
  partner form does not match the balance of the receivable/payable accounts.

- Set the reference in account moves, associated with invoices, that do not
  have the right reference for supplier invoices.
  This is useful to fix the account moves after changing the invoice
  references.
